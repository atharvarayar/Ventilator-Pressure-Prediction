# Ventilator Pressure Prediction

Mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier. This project aims to imulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung. A neural network approach is used as it can better generalize across lungs with varying characteristics. 
The LSTM technique is used as it is apable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.
